### PYTHON DATA TYPES

Python is an object-oriented programming language. Every variable in Python is an instance of some class. There are many pre-defined data types in Python. We can create our own classes to define custom data types.


*Some of the popular data types in Python are:*

- **Numbers** – int, float, complex
- **Sequences** – String, List, Tuple, Set
- **Map** – Dict

### PYTHON STRINGS

Strings in Python are amongst the widely used data types and are created by enclosing characters in quotes. For example: Strings are enclosed within single quotes or double-quotes. Both of these are considered as strings by the interpreter.

```python
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "welcome"
```

### PYTHON OPERATORS

Operators are used to performing a specific operation on variables and values. Python has a lot of operators that are either keywords or special characters. The values or variables on which these operators work are called operands.

*Types of Python Operators
Python operators can be classified into the following categories.*

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Logical Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Membership Operators
7. Identity Operators
